# Data Sources

## Binance

Provides:

* Current price
* 24h price change
* 24h volume

## CoinGecko

Provides:

* Market capitalization
* Circulating supply
* Total supply
* 7-day price change
* 30-day price change

# Known Limitations

## CoinGecko Rate Limit

The public CoinGecko API has request limits.

When rate limiting occurs (HTTP 429):

* prices continue updating normally through Binance;

The system handles this scenario automatically.
